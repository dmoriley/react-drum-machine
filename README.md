# Drum Machine

## To run build script
 - Create src folder at root and add index.js + main content off web app
 - Update import paths inside of index.js to reflect new location
 - if using sass for styles run *npm install node-sass* to add node sass to the project
 - Create a public folder at root of project and put index.html inside
 - After installing all dependencies run *npm run build* which will create a build folder
 - Run local server (could be serve, http-server, live-server...) on folder build
